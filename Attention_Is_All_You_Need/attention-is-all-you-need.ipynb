All images in this notebook will be taken from the Transformer paper.

It also does not use any convolutional layers. Instead the model is entirely made up of linear layers, attention mechanisms and normalization. \n\nAs of January 2020, Transformers are the dominant architecture in NLP and are used to achieve state-of-the-art results for many tasks and it appears as if they will be for the near future. \n\nThe most popular Transformer variant is [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) (**B**idirectional **E**ncoder **R**epresentations from **T**ransformers) and pre-trained versions of BERT are commonly used to replace the embedding layers - if not more - in NLP models. \n\nA common library used when dealing with pre-trained transformers is the [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library, see [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/pretrained_models.html) for a list of all pre-trained models available.\n\nThe differences between the implementation in this notebook and the paper are:\n- we use a learned positional encoding instead of a static one\n- we use the standard Adam optimizer with a static learning rate instead of one with warm-up and cool-down steps\n- we do not use label smoothing\n\nWe make all of these changes as they closely follow BERT's set-up and the majority of Transformer variants use a similar set-up.","metadata":{"id":"lOZJYBXFkM31"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Preparing the Data\n\nAs always, let's import all the required modules

Building the Model\n\nNext, we'll build the model. Like previous notebooks it is made up of an *encoder* and a *decoder*, with the encoder *encoding* the input/source sentence (in German) into *context vector* and the decoder then *decoding* this context vector to output our output/target sentence (in English). \n\n### Encoder\n\nSimilar to the ConvSeq2Seq model, the Transformer's encoder does not attempt to compress the entire source sentence, $X = (x_1, ... ,x_n)$, into a single context vector, $z$. Instead it produces a sequence of context vectors, $Z = (z_1, ... , z_n)$. So, if our input sequence was 5 tokens long we would have $Z = (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)$. Why do we call this a sequence of context vectors and not a sequence of hidden states? A hidden state at time $t$ in an RNN has only seen tokens $x_t$ and all the tokens before it. However, each context vector here has seen all tokens at all positions within the input sequence.\n\n![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/master/assets/transformer-encoder.png?raw=1)\n\nFirst, the tokens are passed through a standard embedding layer. Next, as the model has no recurrent it has no idea about the order of the tokens within the sequence. We solve this by using a second embedding layer called a *positional embedding layer*. This is a standard embedding layer where the input is not the token itself but the position of the token within the sequence, starting with the first token, the `<sos>` (start of sequence) token, in position 0. The position embedding has a \"vocabulary\" size of 100, which means our model can accept sentences up to 100 tokens long. This can be increased if we want to handle longer sentences.\n\nThe original Transformer implementation from the Attention is All You Need paper does not learn positional embeddings. Instead it uses a fixed static embedding. Modern Transformer architectures, like BERT, use positional embeddings instead, hence we have decided to use them in these tutorials. Check out [this](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html#positional-encoding) section to read more about the positional embeddings used in the original Transformer model.\n\nNext, the token and positional embeddings are elementwise summed together to get a vector which contains information about the token and also its position with in the sequence. However, before they are summed, the token embeddings are multiplied by a scaling factor which is $\\sqrt{d_{model}}$, where $d_{model}$ is the hidden dimension size, `hid_dim`. This supposedly reduces variance in the embeddings and the model is difficult to train reliably without this scaling factor. Dropout is then applied to the combined embeddings.\n\nThe combined embeddings are then passed through $N$ *encoder layers* to get $Z$, which is then output and can be used by the decoder.\n\nThe source mask, `src_mask`, is simply the same shape as the source sentence but has a value of 1 when the token in the source sentence is not a `<pad>` token and 0 when it is a `<pad>` token. This is used in the encoder layers to mask the multi-head attention mechanisms, which are used to calculate and apply attention over the source sentence, so the model does not pay attention to `<pad>` tokens, which contain no useful information.","metadata":{"id":"UtUJbVKVkM4I"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Encoder(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, \n                 input_dim, \n                 hid_dim, \n                 n_layers, \n                 n_heads, \n                 pf_dim,\n                 dropout, \n                 device,\n                 max_length = 100):\n        super().__init__()\n\n        self.device = device\n        \n        self.tok_embedding = nn.Embedding(input_dim, hid_dim)\n        self.pos_embedding = nn.Embedding(max_length, hid_dim)\n        \n        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([EncoderLayer(hid_dim, \n                                                  n_heads, \n                                                  pf_dim,\n                                                  dropout, \n                                                  device) \n                                     for _ in range(n_layers)])\n        \n        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n        \n        self.scale = torch.sqrt(torch.FloatTensor([hid_dim])).to(device)\n        \n    def forward(self, src, src_mask):\n        \n        #src = [batch size, src len]\n        #src_mask = [batch size, 1, 1, src len]\n        \n        batch_size = src.shape[0]\n        src_len = src.shape[1]\n        \n        pos = torch.arange(0, src_len).unsqueeze(0).repeat(batch_size, 1).to(self.device)\n        \n        #pos = [batch size, src len]\n        src = self.dropout((self.tok_embedding(src) * self.scale) + self.pos_embedding(pos))\n        \n        #src = [batch size, src len, hid dim]\n        \n        for layer in self.layers:\n            src = layer(src, src_mask)\n            \n        #src = [batch size, src len, hid dim]\n            \n        return src","metadata":{"id":"_5qvPwsFkM4I","tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-04T10:20:13.968802Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-04T10:20:13.969211Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-04T10:20:13.980951Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-04T10:20:13.969175Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-04T10:20:13.979943Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Encoder Layer\n\nThe encoder layers are where all of the \"meat\" of the encoder is contained. We first pass the source sentence and its mask into the *multi-head attention layer*, then perform dropout on it, apply a residual connection and pass it through a [Layer Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450) layer. We then pass it through a *position-wise feedforward* layer and then, again, apply dropout, a residual connection and then layer normalization to get the output of this layer which is fed into the next layer.

This allows neural networks with a larger number of layers, like the Transformer, to be trained easier.","metadata":{"id":"FhllhlDhkM4I"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class EncoderLayer(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, \n                 hid_dim, \n                 n_heads, \n                 pf_dim,  \n                 dropout, \n                 device):\n        super().__init__()\n        \n        self.self_attn_layer_norm = nn.LayerNorm(hid_dim)\n        self.ff_layer_norm = nn.LayerNorm(hid_dim)\n        self.self_attention = MultiHeadAttentionLayer(hid_dim, n_heads, dropout, device)\n        self.positionwise_feedforward = PositionwiseFeedforwardLayer(hid_dim, \n                                                                     pf_dim, \n                                                                     dropout)\n        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n        \n    def forward(self, src, src_mask):\n        \n        #src = [batch size, src len, hid dim]\n        #src_mask = [batch size, 1, 1, src len] \n                \n        #self attention\n        _src, _ = self.self_attention(src, src, src, src_mask)\n        \n        #dropout, residual connection and layer norm\n        src = self.self_attn_layer_norm(src + self.dropout(_src))\n        \n        #src = [batch size, src len, hid dim]\n        \n        #positionwise feedforward\n        _src = self.positionwise_feedforward(src)\n        \n        #dropout, residual and layer norm\n        src = self.ff_layer_norm(src + self.dropout(_src))\n        \n        #src = [batch size, src len, hid dim]\n        \n        return src","metadata":{"id":"Qw2JWP3VkM4J","tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-04T10:20:13.982346Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-04T10:20:13.983147Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-04T10:20:13.992524Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-04T10:20:13.983109Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-04T10:20:13.991484Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Mutli Head Attention Layer\n\nOne of the key, novel concepts introduced by the Transformer paper is the *multi-head attention layer*. \n\n![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/master/assets/transformer-attention.png?raw=1)\n\nAttention can be though of as *queries*, *keys* and *values* - where the query is used with the key to get an attention vector (usually the output of a *softmax* operation and has all values between 0 and 1 which sum to 1) which is then used to get a weighted sum of the values.\n\nThe Transformer uses *scaled dot-product attention*, where the query and key are combined by taking the dot product between them, then applying the softmax operation and scaling by $d_k$ before finally then multiplying by the value. $d_k$ is the *head dimension*, `head_dim`, which we will shortly explain further.\n\n$$ \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Softmax} \\big( \\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}} \\big)V $$ \n\nThis is similar to standard *dot product attention* but is scaled by $d_k$, which the paper states is used to stop the results of the dot products growing large, causing gradients to become too small.\n\nHowever, the scaled dot-product attention isn't simply applied to the queries, keys and values. Instead of doing a single attention application the queries, keys and values have their `hid_dim` split into $h$ *heads* and the scaled dot-product attention is calculated over all heads in parallel. This means instead of paying attention to one concept per attention application, we pay attention to $h$. We then re-combine the heads into their `hid_dim` shape, thus each `hid_dim` is potentially paying attention to $h$ different concepts.\n\n$$ \\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Concat}(\\text{head}_1,...,\\text{head}_h)W^O $$\n\n$$\\text{head}_i = \\text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V) $$\n\n$W^O$ is the linear layer applied at the end of the multi-head attention layer, `fc`. $W^Q, W^K, W^V$ are the linear layers `fc_q`, `fc_k` and `fc_v`.\n\nWalking through the module, first we calculate $QW^Q$, $KW^K$ and $VW^V$ with the linear layers, `fc_q`, `fc_k` and `fc_v`, to give us `Q`, `K` and `V`. Next, we split the `hid_dim` of the query, key and value into `n_heads` using `.view` and correctly permute them so they can be multiplied together. We then calculate the `energy` (the un-normalized attention) by multiplying `Q` and `K` together and scaling it by the square root of `head_dim`, which is calulated as `hid_dim // n_heads`. We then mask the energy so we do not pay attention over any elements of the sequeuence we shouldn't, then apply the softmax and dropout. We then apply the attention to the value heads, `V`, before combining the `n_heads` together. Finally, we multiply this $W^O$, represented by `fc_o`. \n\nNote that in our implementation the lengths of the keys and values are always the same, thus when matrix multiplying the output of the softmax, `attention`, with `V` we will always have valid dimension sizes for matrix multiplication. This multiplication is carried out using `torch.matmul` which, when both tensors are >2-dimensional, does a batched matrix multiplication over the last two dimensions of each tensor. This will be a **[query len, key len] x [value len, head dim]** batched matrix multiplication over the batch size and each head which provides the **[batch size, n heads, query len, head dim]** result.\n\nOne thing that looks strange at first is that dropout is applied directly to the attention. This means that our attention vector will most probably not sum to 1 and we may pay full attention to a token but the attention over that token is set to 0 by dropout. This is never explained, or even mentioned, in the paper however is used by the [official implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/) and every Transformer implementation since, [including BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert/).","metadata":{"id":"EpezPf7GkM4J"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class MultiHeadAttentionLayer(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, hid_dim, n_heads, dropout, device):\n        super().__init__()\n        \n        assert hid_dim % n_heads == 0\n        \n        self.hid_dim = hid_dim\n        self.n_heads = n_heads\n        self.head_dim = hid_dim // n_heads\n        \n        self.fc_q = nn.Linear(hid_dim, hid_dim)\n        self.fc_k = nn.Linear(hid_dim, hid_dim)\n        self.fc_v = nn.Linear(hid_dim, hid_dim)\n        \n        self.fc_o = nn.Linear(hid_dim, hid_dim)\n        \n        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n        \n        self.scale = torch.sqrt(torch.FloatTensor([self.head_dim])).to(device)\n        \n    def forward(self, query, key, value, mask = None):\n        \n        batch_size = query.shape[0]\n        \n        #query = [batch size, query len, hid dim]\n        #key = [batch size, key len, hid dim]\n        #value = [batch size, value len, hid dim]\n                \n        Q = self.fc_q(query)\n        K = self.fc_k(key)\n        V = self.fc_v(value)\n        \n        #Q = [batch size, query len, hid dim]\n        #K = [batch size, key len, hid dim]\n        #V = [batch size, value len, hid dim]\n                \n        Q = Q.view(batch_size, -1, self.n_heads, self.head_dim).permute(0, 2, 1, 3)\n        K = K.view(batch_size, -1, self.n_heads, self.head_dim).permute(0, 2, 1, 3)\n        V = V.view(batch_size, -1, self.n_heads, self.head_dim).permute(0, 2, 1, 3)\n        \n        #Q = [batch size, n heads, query len, head dim]\n        #K = [batch size, n heads, key len, head dim]\n        #V = [batch size, n heads, value len, head dim]\n                \n        energy = torch.matmul(Q, K.permute(0, 1, 3, 2)) / self.scale\n        \n        #energy = [batch size, n heads, query len, key len]\n        \n        if mask is not None:\n            energy = energy.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e10)\n        \n        attention = torch.softmax(energy, dim = -1)\n                \n        #attention = [batch size, n heads, query len, key len]\n                \n        x = torch.matmul(self.dropout(attention), V)\n        \n        #x = [batch size, n heads, query len, head dim]\n        \n        x = x.permute(0, 2, 1, 3).contiguous()\n        \n        #x = [batch size, query len, n heads, head dim]\n        \n        x = x.view(batch_size, -1, self.hid_dim)\n        \n        #x = [batch size, query len, hid dim]\n        \n        x = self.fc_o(x)\n        \n        #x = [batch size, query len, hid dim]\n        \n        return x, attention","metadata":{"id":"KzjOWuQgkM4J","tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-04T10:20:13.993868Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-04T10:20:13.994601Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.008671Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-04T10:20:13.994564Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.008042Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Position-wise Feedforward Layer\n\nThe other main block inside the encoder layer is the *position-wise feedforward layer* This is relatively simple compared to the multi-head attention layer.

A *masked multi-head attention layer* over the target sequence, and a multi-head attention layer which uses the decoder representation as the query and the encoder representation as the key and value.\n\nThe decoder uses positional embeddings and combines - via an elementwise sum - them with the scaled embedded target tokens, followed by dropout. Again, our positional encodings have a \"vocabulary\" of 100, which means they can accept sequences up to 100 tokens long. This can be increased if desired.\n\nThe combined embeddings are then passed through the $N$ decoder layers, along with the encoded source, `enc_src`, and the source and target masks. Note that the number of layers in the encoder does not have to be equal to the number of layers in the decoder, even though they are both denoted by $N$.\n\nThe decoder representation after the $N^{th}$ layer is then passed through a linear layer, `fc_out`. In PyTorch, the softmax operation is contained within our loss function, so we do not explicitly need to use a softmax layer here.\n\nAs well as using the source mask, as we did in the encoder to prevent our model attending to `<pad>` tokens, we also use a target mask. This will be explained further in the `Seq2Seq` model which encapsulates both the encoder and decoder, but the gist of it is that it performs a similar operation as the decoder padding in the convolutional sequence-to-sequence model. As we are processing all of the target tokens at once in parallel we need a method of stopping the decoder from \"cheating\" by simply \"looking\" at what the next token in the target sequence is and outputting it. \n\nOur decoder layer also outputs the normalized attention values so we can later plot them to see what our model is actually paying attention to.","metadata":{"id":"O9sxqDoPkM4K"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Decoder(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, \n                 output_dim, \n                 hid_dim, \n                 n_layers, \n                 n_heads, \n                 pf_dim, \n                 dropout, \n                 device,\n                 max_length = 100):\n        super().__init__()\n        \n        self.device = device\n        \n        self.tok_embedding = nn.Embedding(output_dim, hid_dim)\n        self.pos_embedding = nn.Embedding(max_length, hid_dim)\n        \n        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([DecoderLayer(hid_dim, \n                                                  n_heads, \n                                                  pf_dim, \n                                                  dropout, \n                                                  device)\n                                     for _ in range(n_layers)])\n        \n        self.fc_out = nn.Linear(hid_dim, output_dim)\n        \n        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n        \n        self.scale = torch.sqrt(torch.FloatTensor([hid_dim])).to(device)\n        \n    def forward(self, trg, enc_src, trg_mask, src_mask):\n        \n        #trg = [batch size, trg len]\n        #enc_src = [batch size, src len, hid dim]\n        #trg_mask = [batch size, 1, trg len, trg len]\n        #src_mask = [batch size, 1, 1, src len]\n                \n        batch_size = trg.shape[0]\n        trg_len = trg.shape[1]\n        \n        pos = torch.arange(0, trg_len).unsqueeze(0).repeat(batch_size, 1).to(self.device)\n                            \n        #pos = [batch size, trg len]\n            \n        trg = self.dropout((self.tok_embedding(trg) * self.scale) + self.pos_embedding(pos))\n                \n        #trg = [batch size, trg len, hid dim]\n        \n        for layer in self.layers:\n            trg, attention = layer(trg, enc_src, trg_mask, src_mask)\n        \n        #trg = [batch size, trg len, hid dim]\n        #attention = [batch size, n heads, trg len, src len]\n        \n        output = self.fc_out(trg)\n        \n        #output = [batch size, trg len, output dim]\n            \n        return output, attention","metadata":{"id":"weG0PpjSkM4K","tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.023078Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.024008Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.035377Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.023919Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.034555Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Decoder Layer\n\nAs mentioned previously, the decoder layer is similar to the encoder layer except that it now has two multi-head attention layers, `self_attention` and `encoder_attention`. \n\nThe first performs self-attention, as in the encoder, by using the decoder representation so far as the query, key and value.

This is then followed by the dropout, residual connection and layer normalization layers. \n\nFinally, we pass this through the position-wise feedforward layer and yet another sequence of dropout, residual connection and layer normalization.\n\nThe decoder layer isn't introducing any new concepts, just using the same set of layers as the encoder in a slightly different way.","metadata":{"id":"Dk-m-QsekM4L"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class DecoderLayer(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, \n                 hid_dim, \n                 n_heads, \n                 pf_dim, \n                 dropout, \n                 device):\n        super().__init__()\n        \n        self.self_attn_layer_norm = nn.LayerNorm(hid_dim)\n        self.enc_attn_layer_norm = nn.LayerNorm(hid_dim)\n        self.ff_layer_norm = nn.LayerNorm(hid_dim)\n        self.self_attention = MultiHeadAttentionLayer(hid_dim, n_heads, dropout, device)\n        self.encoder_attention = MultiHeadAttentionLayer(hid_dim, n_heads, dropout, device)\n        self.positionwise_feedforward = PositionwiseFeedforwardLayer(hid_dim, \n                                                                     pf_dim, \n                                                                     dropout)\n        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n        \n    def forward(self, trg, enc_src, trg_mask, src_mask):\n        \n        #trg = [batch size, trg len, hid dim]\n        #enc_src = [batch size, src len, hid dim]\n        #trg_mask = [batch size, 1, trg len, trg len]\n        #src_mask = [batch size, 1, 1, src len]\n        \n        #self attention\n        _trg, _ = self.self_attention(trg, trg, trg, trg_mask)\n        \n        #dropout, residual connection and layer norm\n        trg = self.self_attn_layer_norm(trg + self.dropout(_trg))\n            \n        #trg = [batch size, trg len, hid dim]\n            \n        #encoder attention\n        _trg, attention = self.encoder_attention(trg, enc_src, enc_src, src_mask)\n        \n        #dropout, residual connection and layer norm\n        trg = self.enc_attn_layer_norm(trg + self.dropout(_trg))\n                    \n        #trg = [batch size, trg len, hid dim]\n        \n        #positionwise feedforward\n        _trg = self.positionwise_feedforward(trg)\n        \n        #dropout, residual and layer norm\n        trg = self.ff_layer_norm(trg + self.dropout(_trg))\n        \n        #trg = [batch size, trg len, hid dim]\n        #attention = [batch size, n heads, trg len, src len]\n        \n        return trg, attention","metadata":{"id":"b_UjrX9gkM4L","tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.037092Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.037810Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.048826Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.037774Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.048150Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Seq2Seq\n\nFinally, we have the `Seq2Seq` module which encapsulates the encoder and decoder, as well as handling the creation of the masks.\n\nThe source mask is created by checking where the source sequence is not equal to a `<pad>` token. It is 1 where the token is not a `<pad>` token and 0 when it is. It is then unsqueezed so it can be correctly broadcast when applying the mask to the `energy`, which of shape **_[batch size, n heads, seq len, seq len]_**.\n\nThe target mask is slightly more complicated. First, we create a mask for the `<pad>` tokens, as we did for the source mask. Next, we create a \"subsequent\" mask, `trg_sub_mask`, using `torch.tril`. This creates a diagonal matrix where the elements above the diagonal will be zero and the elements below the diagonal will be set to whatever the input tensor is. In this case, the input tensor will be a tensor filled with ones. So this means our `trg_sub_mask` will look something like this (for a target with 5 tokens):\n\n$$\\begin{matrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n\\end{matrix}$$\n\nThis shows what each target token (row) is allowed to look at (column). The first target token has a mask of **_[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]_** which means it can only look at the first target token. The second target token has a mask of **_[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]_** which it means it can look at both the first and second target tokens. \n\nThe \"subsequent\" mask is then logically anded with the padding mask, this combines the two masks ensuring both the subsequent tokens and the padding tokens cannot be attended to. For example if the last two tokens were `<pad>` tokens the mask would look like:\n\n$$\\begin{matrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n\\end{matrix}$$\n\nAfter the masks are created, they used with the encoder and decoder along with the source and target sentences to get our predicted target sentence, `output`, along with the decoder's attention over the source sequence.","metadata":{"id":"637YzZ7AkM4L"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Seq2Seq(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, \n                 encoder, \n                 decoder, \n                 src_pad_idx, \n                 trg_pad_idx, \n                 device):\n        super().__init__()\n        \n        self.encoder = encoder\n        self.decoder = decoder\n        self.src_pad_idx = src_pad_idx\n        self.trg_pad_idx = trg_pad_idx\n        self.device = device\n        \n    def make_src_mask(self, src):\n        \n        #src = [batch size, src len]\n        \n        src_mask = (src != self.src_pad_idx).unsqueeze(1).unsqueeze(2)\n\n        #src_mask = [batch size, 1, 1, src len]\n\n        return src_mask\n    \n    def make_trg_mask(self, trg):\n        \n        #trg = [batch size, trg len]\n        \n        trg_pad_mask = (trg != self.trg_pad_idx).unsqueeze(1).unsqueeze(2)\n        \n        #trg_pad_mask = [batch size, 1, 1, trg len]\n        \n        trg_len = trg.shape[1]\n        \n        trg_sub_mask = torch.tril(torch.ones((trg_len, trg_len), device = self.device)).bool()\n        \n        #trg_sub_mask = [trg len, trg len]\n            \n        trg_mask = trg_pad_mask & trg_sub_mask\n        \n        #trg_mask = [batch size, 1, trg len, trg len]\n        \n        return trg_mask\n\n    def forward(self, src, trg):\n        \n        #src = [batch size, src len]\n        #trg = [batch size, trg len]\n                \n        src_mask = self.make_src_mask(src)\n        trg_mask = self.make_trg_mask(trg)\n        \n        #src_mask = [batch size, 1, 1, src len]\n        #trg_mask = [batch size, 1, trg len, trg len]\n        \n        enc_src = self.encoder(src, src_mask)\n        \n        #enc_src = [batch size, src len, hid dim]\n                \n        output, attention = self.decoder(trg, enc_src, trg_mask, src_mask)\n        \n        #output = [batch size, trg len, output dim]\n        #attention = [batch size, n heads, trg len, src len]\n        \n        return output, attention","metadata":{"id":"-jdXKtDskM4L","tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.050174Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.051163Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.061679Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.051127Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-04T10:20:14.060935Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Training the Seq2Seq Model\n\nWe can now define our encoder and decoders.

They all seem to follow the similar \"downward staircase\" pattern and the attention when outputting the last two tokens is equally spread over the final two tokens in the input sentence.","metadata":{"id":"KQcvzEjAkM4R"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"display_attention(src, translation, attention)","metadata":{"id":"3j3l1V43kM4R","outputId":"e62b2555-9ed9-4172-ed80-3b399bd8bd1b","tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-04T10:22:03.363900Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-04T10:22:03.364404Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-04T10:22:03.364155Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-04T10:22:03.364180Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Next, let's get an example the model has not been trained on from the validation set.","metadata":{"id":"tS2Q4RCckM4S"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"example_idx = 6\n\nsrc = vars(valid_data.examples[example_idx])['src']\ntrg = vars(valid_data.examples[example_idx])['trg']\n\nprint(f'src = {src}')\nprint(f'trg = {trg}')","metadata":{"id":"-kmHHOBvkM4S","outputId":"3b4df574-3bff-4158-863f-6905e1694b4c","tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-04T10:22:03.366193Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-04T10:22:03.366677Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-04T10:22:03.366427Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-04T10:22:03.366452Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The model translates it by switching *is running* to just *runs*, but it is an acceptable swap.","metadata":{"id":"YtAEvAfAkM4S"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"translation, attention = translate_sentence(src, SRC, TRG, model, device)\n\nprint(f'predicted trg = {translation}')","metadata":{"id":"gSls--6EkM4S","outputId":"c5601874-3623-46da-da38-0422da44eaa3","tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-04T10:22:03.368767Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-04T10:22:03.369573Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-04T10:22:03.369144Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-04T10:22:03.369199Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Again, some heads pay full attention to \"ein\" whilst some pay no attention to it.
